以下快速参考总结了 Java 编程语言支持的运算符。

## 简单的分配运算符

```
=       Simple assignment operator

```

## 算术运算符

```
+       Additive operator (also used
        for String concatenation)
-       Subtraction operator
*       Multiplication operator
/       Division operator
%       Remainder operator

```

## 一元运算符

```
+       Unary plus operator; indicates
        positive value (numbers are 
        positive without this, however)
-       Unary minus operator; negates
        an expression
++      Increment operator; increments
        a value by 1
--      Decrement operator; decrements
        a value by 1
!       Logical complement operator;
        inverts the value of a boolean

```

## 平等和关系运算符

```
==      Equal to
!=      Not equal to
>       Greater than
>=      Greater than or equal to
<       Less than
<=      Less than or equal to

```

## 条件运算符

```
&&      Conditional-AND
||      Conditional-OR
?:      Ternary (shorthand for 
        if-then-else statement)

```

## 类型比较运算符

```
instanceof      Compares an object to 
                a specified type 

```

## 按位和位移运算符

```
~       Unary bitwise complement
<<      Signed left shift
>>      Signed right shift
>>>     Unsigned right shift
&       Bitwise AND
^       Bitwise exclusive OR
|       Bitwise inclusive OR

```
